+FX1 Digital Hubs is an onchain creative ecosystem built on the Base blockchain, designed to empower creators, collectors, and digital entrepreneurs through a unified hub of tools: NFT fashion art, smart-contract powered creator assets, onchain identity, and gamified digital experiences.
+
+At its core, FX1 Digital Hubs solves one major problem in Web3:
+Most creators don’t have a simple, accessible, and engaging way to build, showcase, monetize, and expand their onchain presence — all from one place.
+
+FX1 Digital Hubs brings everything together in one ecosystem:
+	•	Onchain Fashion Art Hub: Create, collect, and showcase NFT fashion pieces and surreal digital wearables on Base.
+	•	Smart Contract Hub: Deploy custom creator contracts, dynamic NFTs, and utility-based assets easily.
+	•	Digital Wardrobe Mini-App: A gamified experience where users build an onchain identity through fashion, collectibles, and achievements.
+	•	Creator Passport: A Zora-powered onchain passport that unlocks access to future quests, drops, and community experiences.
+	•	$FDH Ecosystem: A micro-token economy that rewards engagement, creativity, and participation.
+	•	Community Space: A home for Web3 creators, designers, writers, and digital builders to collaborate and grow.
+
+Who is it for?
+• Web3 creators
+• NFT artists
+• Digital fashion designers
+• Collectors
+• Onchain entrepreneurs
+• Anyone exploring digital identity onchain
+
+Problems FX1 Digital Hubs Solves:
+	•	Fragmented creative tools scattered across multiple platforms
+	•	Lack of simple onboarding into NFT creation and digital fashion
+	•	No unified space for onchain identity, creator economy, and interactive experiences
+	•	Limited visibility for small Web3 builders
+	•	No accessible gateway to bring more African creatives onchain
+
+FX1 Digital Hubs is built for the future of digital culture — where art, fashion, identity, and smart contracts connect to create new economic opportunities.
+
+I am actively building this as a one-man founder and young dad, fully committed to Base for almost two years. Right now, I’m seeking an angel investor, partner, or collaborator who sees the vision and wants to help take this project to the moon.
+
+FX1 Digital Hubs is early, raw, and powerful — and with the right backing, it can become the leading onchain creative hub on Base.
